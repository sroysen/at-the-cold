cluster-in-a-box
================

Creates and manage a mongodb cluster (a sharded group of nodes, each one a replicaset with at least three mongod instances) in the local machine.
Provides an easy way to administrate it as a group or individually, to provide a learning sandbox for developers and DBAs as well.
